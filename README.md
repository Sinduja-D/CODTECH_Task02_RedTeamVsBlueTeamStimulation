_**Overview of the Project**_

**Project:**

Red Team vs. Blue Team Simulation

**Objective:**

Conduct a comprehensive and realistic simulation of a cyber attack against a network, where the Red Team (attackers) will attempt to breach the security of the network, and the Blue Team (defenders) will respond to and mitigate the attacks. 
The goal is to test the effectiveness of the network's defenses, identify vulnerabilities, and develop strategies for improving incident response and incident management.

**Simulation Objectives:**

1. **Attack Scenarios:** The Red Team will execute multiple attack scenarios,like:
	* Phishing emails with malicious attachments and links
	* Social engineering attempts to gain user credentials
	* Network exploitation using known vulnerabilities
	* Use of malware and ransomware
	* DNS spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks
2. **Defense Strategies:** The Blue Team will employ various defense strategies, like:
	* Network segmentation and access control
	* Firewall rules and configuration
	* Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
	* Endpoint protection and antivirus software
	* Incident response procedures and playbooks

**Conclusion:**

The Red Team vs. Blue Team simulation will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of our network security defenses, identify vulnerabilities, and inform strategies for improving incident response and incident management. By conducting this exercise regularly, we can ensure that our organization remains vigilant in the face of evolving cyber threats.
